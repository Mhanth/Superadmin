# Pulse Admin Panel

This is a React-based superadmin dashboard built with a single large component (`PulseAdminPanel.jsx`).

## Setup

```bash
cd "c:\Users\LENOVO\Downloads\Firsst Website\Superadmin"
npm install
npm run dev
```

The project uses Vite for development and building.

## Structure

- `src/` contains application entry point and component
- `PulseAdminPanel.jsx` holds the main UI logic

## Notes

The UI is currently using inline styles and mock data. Convert to real APIs and split into smaller components for production readiness.
